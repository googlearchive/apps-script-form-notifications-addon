  This version of <i>Form Notifications</i> is a fork of <i>Form Notifications</i> (https://github.com/googlesamples/apps-script-form-notifications-addon).
  It added the possibility to add the form content to the respondent notification email so that the end-user has a copy of what he filled out.
  </p>
  <p>
  <i>Form Notifications</i> was created as an sample add-on, and is meant
  for demonstration purposes only. It should not be used for complex or
  important workflows.
  </p>
  <p>
  The number of notifications this add-on produces are limited by the owner's
  available email quota; it will not send email notifications if the owner's
  daily email quota has been exceeded. Collaborators using this add-on on the
  same form will be able to adjust the notification settings, but will not be
  able to disable the notification triggers set by other collaborators.
